Lightning Animation using CircuitPython and an Adafruit CircuitPlayground Bluefruit

Derived from the [Adafruit Bluetooth Snow Globe guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/snow-globe-bluefruit-cpb/code-the-bluetooth-snow-globe) - follow instructions there for installation of CircuitPython and required libraries.

An STL file is provided as a base for the globe. This is derived from the [NASA 3D model of the Block Island rock](https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/block-island) from Mars.

The relevant lightning code is contained within the `lightning(config)` block.
